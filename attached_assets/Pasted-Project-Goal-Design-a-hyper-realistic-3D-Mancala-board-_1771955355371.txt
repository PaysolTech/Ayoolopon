Project Goal:
Design a hyper-realistic 3D Mancala board with natural seed pieces and a working center hinge that allows the board to close into half its size when a “Close Board” button is clicked.

🪵 BOARD DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS

Board Type:
Traditional wooden Mancala board (12 small pits + 2 larger end stores).

Material:

Solid carved African hardwood (mahogany or teak look)

Natural wood grain visible

Slight imperfections and texture variation

Matte finish (not glossy plastic)

Subtle wear marks near pits to simulate real gameplay use

Color Tone:

Warm medium-brown wood

Slight darker edges

Inner pit areas slightly smoother from hand contact

Dimensions (Realistic Proportion):

Length: 18–22 inches (realistic scale)

Each pit carved deeply with smooth rounded edges

Two larger end pits (stores) slightly deeper and wider

🧩 HINGE DESIGN (IMPORTANT)

Board must have a visible metal hinge in the center (between the 6th and 7th pit)

Hinge material: brushed brass or antique metal

Screws visible and slightly recessed

When closed:

Board folds perfectly in half

Seeds remain inside pits (no falling through)

Exterior becomes smooth wood surface

Add smooth folding animation (300–500ms)

Slight wood creak sound optional

Close Button Behavior:

When user clicks “Close Board”:

Trigger hinge rotation at center axis

Smooth rotation animation

Board snaps shut softly

When “Open Board” is clicked:

Reverse animation

Board lays flat on surface

🌰 SEED DESIGN (VERY IMPORTANT)

Seed Type:

Natural game seeds (similar to African Oware seeds)

Small round pebbles or dried seed beads

Slight variation in shape and color

Color Palette:

Light sage green

Muted olive

Pale stone grey

Slight off-white variations

Texture:

Smooth but organic (not perfectly spherical)

Slight surface imperfections

Natural matte finish

Micro-shadow where seeds touch wood

Physics (Optional Enhancement):

Seeds should:

Sit naturally inside curved pit

Slightly overlap randomly

Rotate randomly on redistribution

Have soft collision physics

💡 LIGHTING & ENVIRONMENT

Natural window light from one side

Soft shadows inside pits

Ambient warm light tone

Slight table surface reflection

Background: wooden table or neutral soft surface

🎮 INTERACTION BEHAVIOR

When seeds are redistributed:

Animate seeds moving pit-to-pit

Natural rolling motion

Soft collision sounds

No robotic snapping movement

When board closes:

Seeds remain inside their pits

No clipping through surface

No unrealistic stacking

📦 CAMERA SPECIFICATIONS

Default View:

Slight top-down 30–40° angle

Full board visible

Optional:

Zoom-in animation during seed movement

Slight depth-of-field blur for realism

🎨 Rendering Style

Photorealistic

Not cartoon

Not flat 2D

Real-world proportions

Subtle imperfections to avoid CGI look

🔥 Advanced Enhancement (Optional Premium Realism)

Add:

Tiny scratches near high-use pits

Very subtle dust in corners

Micro wood grain bump mapping

Seed shadow occlusion inside pit curve
